transformers - gonna make a neural network from scratch, no video watching and whatnot on how to make it gonna make it myself.


todos:
1. fix the chatbot model so it outputs different outputs every time
2. manipulating matrices requires a good understanding of linear algebra, and since matrices change shape every pass through a hidden layer, knowing what shape it is and how to use them is very helpful to understand fundamentals
3. why do smaller numbers work better in neural networks ergo why dividing the training data by 255 help the accuracy significantly
